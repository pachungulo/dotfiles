# My personal dotfiles

My dotfiles just the way I like em. If you see mistakes/non ideal stuff, let me know! I'd love the help!

I manage my dotfiles with [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi), it's available everywhere, even for
termux on android.

## Installation

Just download [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi) through the package manager of your choice and follow the
instructions on their site for chezmoi init.

As always, never run another person's dotfiles setup blindly unless you're either ready to screw things up or are using a disposable enviroment (VM or container).

## Neovim

I prefer to keep my neovim config in a seperate repository, as I'm trying to make these dotfiles more minimal. 
[Here](https://github.com/pachungulo/nvim-config) is my config.


## Recommended installed software

These should be installed through a package manager ideally:
    - ripgrep for Neovim
    - Some TLDR client
    - A nice terminal
    - fish shell
